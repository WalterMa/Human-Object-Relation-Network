 Surrounding object information has been widely used for action recognition. However, the relation between human and object,
 as an important cue, is usually ignored in the still image action recognition field. In this paper, we propose a novel 
 approach for action recognition. The key to ours is a human-object relation module. By using the appearance as well as 
 the spatial location of human and object, the module can compute the pair-wise relation information between human and 
 object to enhance features for action classification and can be trained jointly with our action recognition network. 
 Experimental results on two popular datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
  Moreover, our method yields the new state-of-the-art results of 92.8% and 94.6% mAP on the PASCAL VOC 2012 Action and Stanford 40 
  Actions datasets respectively.

## Installation

This project is developed on `Python 3.6` with `MXNet` framework.

### Python Packages

```text
mxnet==1.6.0
gluoncv==0.7.0 [optional]
pycocotools==2.0 [optional]
numpy==1.15.4
matplotlib==2.2.2
tqdm==4.23.4
```

The optional packages are only required if you want to detect object bounding boxes for your own dataset.
