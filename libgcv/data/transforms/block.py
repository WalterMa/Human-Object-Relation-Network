class RandomCrop(Block):
    """Randomly crop `src` with `size` (width, height).
    Padding is optional.
    Upsample result if `src` is smaller than `size`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    size : int or tuple of (W, H)
        Size of the final output.
    pad: int or tuple
        if int, size of the zero-padding
        if tuple, number of values padded to the edges of each axis.
            ((before_1, after_1), ... (before_N, after_N)) unique pad widths for each axis.
            ((before, after),) yields same before and after pad for each axis.
            (pad,) or int is a shortcut for before = after = pad width for all axes.
    interpolation : int
        Interpolation method for resizing. By default uses bilinear
        interpolation. See OpenCV's resize function for available choices.


    Inputs:
        - **data**: input tensor with (Hi x Wi x C) shape.
    Outputs:
        - **out**: output tensor with ((H+2*pad) x (W+2*pad) x C) shape.
